How keys look like?
For those who are new to keys management, lets look at sample keys first. 

Private key (.pem file extension)
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED
DEK-Info: DES-EDE3-CBC,32495A90F3FF199D
lrMAsSjjkKiRxGdgR8p5kZJj0AFgdWYa3OT2snIXnN5+/p7j13PSkseUcrAFyokc
.......

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

and Public key looks like
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAxzYuc22QSst/dS7geYYK
.....
r3F7aM9YpErzeYLrl0GhQr9BVJxOvXcVd4kmY+XkiCcrkyS1cnghnllh+LCwQu1s
YwIDAQAB
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

Note: 
Notice, begining line & ending line of each file. Thats how you know, whether you looking at private key or public key. 

How to generate keys. 
Depending upon operating system, there are many different ways. 
Linux (or alike ), they come with many utilities out-of-box. 
1. ssh-keygen
2. openssl

In Windows OS, you can use puttygen (google it, to download, putty* tools)

Different types of keys
Keys can be categoried based on algorithm and strength. 
Algorithms are like RSA or EC
And strength is number field like 64 / 128 / 256 /512 / 1024 / 2048 / 4096 .. 
Higher the strength, more difficult to crack that key. Hence you 
EC

Most common is RSA. But these days, EC is being preferred for it's speed and more security.
